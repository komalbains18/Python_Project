# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of our project will be called "To-Do-Lists"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists, with features such as adding, deleting tasks and marking tasks as completed.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will have a home screen where users can view all their tasks, add, delete and mark tasks as completed.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Student name: Komaldeep Bains , Email: Tun59318@temple.edu , TA: Yihan Zhang 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A user interface where users can add, mark complete and delete tasks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can add addidional features where user is allowed to customize the page, such as change background color. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish at least the basic features that makes the web-app function. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

New skills we will need to acquie is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We will need to research how to apply the features we want to using these skills. We will need to work together to make sure we are on the same page and to make sure we are using the skills we have learned. Both of us will be working on the project together.
